# Neural-Networks
Implementation of Neural networks like CNN(Convolutanary Neural Network) , RNN(Recurrent Neural network) for image recognition, Digit recognition, Google stock predictions. If you want to download and implement this code download the csv files which are the training and testing datasets and make
sure you have installed python along with Tensorflow and Keras modules
